When writing my resume there's information about myself that has to be removed in order to give space to all the necessary technical jargon. This great [Blog Post](https://elisabethirgens.github.io/notes/2020/09/to-all-jobs-i-had-before/) by @elisabethirg gave me the idea to look back at all those odd jobs I had before becoming a developer and the lessons I learned from them.

üçé Asparagus Picker: There is real value in being a part of the community
This was my first real job. I was 14 working on my neighbors farm where I helped them pick asparagus and run their farmers stand. The farmer stand seemed to always be profitable despite the fact that all our locally sourced produce was noticeably more expensive then what you would see at the grocery store. The reason for this was because the owner was very knowledgable, he knew a good bushel of peaches when he saw it and if the peaches didn't look good, he wouldn't sell them. He maintained this honest and dependable relationship with the community and people kept coming back.

üßπ Store Clerk: Sweep Twice, Mop Once
In the summers while I was in highschool I worked at a small general store scooping icecream, stocking shelves, running the cash register, and cleaning the store. The owner had a single rule for cleaning the store floors at the end of the day. Sweep twice, mop once. Going back and resweeping always resulted in a cleaner store and he could tell if we didn't sweep twice. I try and maintain this mentality whenever possible whether I'm writing a blog post, building a webapp, or cleaning the kitchen. It may not seem like much but catching those typos and other obvious mistakes quickly can make noticeably difference in the end result.

üöö Dock Worker: It's OK to slow down
Once I turned 18 I was finally able to get a non minimum wage job at a local milk processing plant. I worked on the recieving dock, unloading crates of milk from trucks. All of us on the dock tried to get the truck unloaded as quickly as possible. But one day we had to unload a trailer full of milk that had been left out in an unrefigerated truck for a few days in the summer sun. We were so focused on emptying the truck as fast as possible that one of us slipped while dragging a stack of cartons and spilled about 24 gallons of spoiled milk all over the dock. I will never forget that smell. Sometimes its better to be less efficient but more stable. Here's a great article from Psyche on this topic: [Why efficiency is dangerous and slowing down makes life better](https://psyche.co/ideas/why-efficiency-is-dangerous-and-slowing-down-makes-life-better).

üì± Mobile Phone Sales: Learn how to explain things
This job mainly consisted of stocking phone chargers and explaining the difference between the iPhone 6s and the Galaxy s6. It could be frustrating, the phone's names were similar, they looked the same, and they had similar hardware. The patience and conversational skills I learned from helping explain the differences to customers has remained useful.</p>

üçï Pizza Delivery Guy: Some jobs are better then others
I got this job when I came home for the summer of my freshmen year. I loved delivering pizza, I got to work late at night, drive my car, listen to my music, and make money?! The only downsides to this job was that customers were rude and it made my car smell like a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle. So I guess the lesson is "maybe give pizza delivery a try?".
